// todo google some basic OOP articles
//todo First spent some time reading these classes and really understand what they are doing.

// face card jack, king, or queen = 10
// Ace = 11

//  object = properties and methods (also called instances)
/*  properties = variables and constants (classmember variables) (also called fields, attributes)
    The properties hold specific data and related with the class in which it has been defined*/
//  methods = functions

// class is a construct from which objects are created
//includes properties and methods (objects)
// To create an object out of a class, the new keyword must be used.

//method
//A class method is exactly similar to PHP functions.
